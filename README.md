# 723 week 7 class 1

### Homework Task:
* To have a good rest!
* To publish a link to Webinar video source (Week 6) </br>
  (Please, keep in mind: Page-> Image->Link->VideoSource)
  
* To present the code, used in the webinar</br>
e.g.
  ```python
  # declare the variable A and define the value that is stored
  A = 22
  
  '''
  declare the function fun(.) with one parameter, namely b, 
  visible ONLY inside the function body
  '''
  def fun(b):
      print (b)
      
  # Invoke the function fun(.) with the A as the parameter   
  fun(A)    
  ```
* Reflect on the webinar of recent week applying the short convoying text.
* In other words, just do the best!
